# The movie database

Simple app that shows some info about movies.

## Required step before building the project!!!

Before build, it is required to create **apikey.properties** file inside the root folder of the project and define API_KEY property here. API_KEY is necessary for the API calls to 
[the movie database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started).

```properties
API_KEY="{your_api_key}"
```>
